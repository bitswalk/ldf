lets focus on the ldf server for this one.
I'd like we cleanup a bit the source code, split it up logically, for instance gets Interfaces put on their own file but yet still on the same namespace (package), as for now we gets a bunch of very long files, which, even if perfectly working aren't really readable for maintainability.
